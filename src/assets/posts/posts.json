    "description": "Welcome to part one of my three part series on web maps. My goal in this series is to explain, at a high level, how web maps work. In particular, I will attempt to shed light on how web maps are able to convert geographic locations (e.g. the lat/long of a particular restaurant) into positions within a viewport (an HTML DOM element) and how they are able to update these positions when a user zooms or pans the web map."
